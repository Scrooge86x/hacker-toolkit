# [unindent-literal](../../include/hackertoolkit/unindent-literal.h)

Unindent raw string literals at compile time.

It's not really related to hacking, but it's been a useful utility for me, so I might as well include it.

Pretty useful if you need to format some user facing text but want it to still look nice and not out of place in your code.
