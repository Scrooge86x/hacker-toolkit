# [htk-defer](../../include/hackertoolkit/htk-defer.h)

Useful helper when working with C style apis.
It's called HTK_DEFER because DEFER would be a too generic name that could clash.

Not strictly for hacking, but it's useful when working with C apis,
which most likely you WILL be doing at some point.
